## The Fundamental Loop

Claude performs dramatically better when it can verify its own work:

```
Explore → Plan → Code → Verify → (loop if needed)
```

Discrete loops prevent one-shotting complex projects. Planning separated from execution improves outcomes.

## Five Core Patterns

### 1. Spec → Plan → Execute

Separate planning from execution entirely. Planning agent researches and produces a structured plan; execution agent follows it. Prevents "getting over your skis" on complex projects.

### 2. Two-Agent Architecture (Long-Running Tasks)

- **Initializer** (first session): Creates structured artifacts (JSON feature list, progress file, architecture docs)
- **Coding Agent** (incremental sessions): Picks up work from artifacts, makes progress, updates state
- State tracking via JSON (model less likely to inappropriately modify vs. Markdown) and git history

### 3. Subagent Delegation

Route complex research to [[subagents]] to keep the main context focused:

- Subagents return only summaries (1,000–2,000 tokens) vs. exploration tokens (tens of thousands)
- Main agent stays within its token budget and focused on the current task

### 4. Progressive Context Loading

Implement [[progressive-disclosure]] for instructions:

- Path-scoped rules trigger only when matching files are read
- Skills load full instructions only when invoked
- Subagent summaries replace full exploration traces

### 5. Orchestrator Pattern

Team lead coordinates multiple agents working in parallel:

- Shared task list with claim/complete workflow
- Task dependencies prevent premature work
- Direct communication between teammates
- Available in Claude Code via Agent Teams (experimental)

## Context Management During Workflows

| Strategy                        | Complexity | Effectiveness                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Auto-compaction (summarization) | Low        | Matches sophisticated alternatives |
| JSON state files                | Low        | Reliable for structured data       |
| Git-based state tracking        | Medium     | Natural for code-producing agents  |
| External memory (CLAUDE.md)     | Medium     | Persistent across sessions         |
| Subagent architecture           | High       | Best for parallel/complex work     |

Boris Cherny's principle applies: prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex memory architectures. Auto-compaction via summarization (asking Claude to summarize its context) works as well as more sophisticated approaches.

## Anti-Patterns

- **One-shotting complex projects** — Fails predictably; use discrete loops
- **Accumulating failed approaches** — After 2 failed corrections, clear context and restart
- **Overly generic instructions** — Specific credentialed personas outperform generic "helpful assistant" labels
- **Aggressive delegation language** — Replace "CRITICAL: You MUST" with normal guidance "Use when..."
